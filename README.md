# project title:
Battery Electric Bus Deployment in the Greater Salt Lake Region
Group Members: Yinhu Wang & Yirong Zhou

This project develops a visulization of battery electric bus deployment plan under different investment budget in the Greater Salt Lake Region. Three views are designed and each of them displays a distinct visulization. The first view shows the baisc attrbiute data related to each traffic analysis zone. The second view is used to exhibit the electric bus route network and the lcoation of charging stations. The last view presents a plot which quantify the effect of different deployment plan. These three view can jointly interact to show the bus netwrok and service area under a sepcific budget.
